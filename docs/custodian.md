# Custodians

Welcome, and *Thank you* for volunteering to be a custodian of an ArmoredWitness device!

This page serves as an introduction and starting point for the care and feeding of the devices. If you have any
questions at all which aren't covered here, please don't hesitate to find us on the
[transparency-dev slack](https://transparency-dev.slack.com/)
[[invite]](https://join.slack.com/t/transparency-dev/shared_invite/zt-27pkqo21d-okUFhur7YZ0rFoJVIOPznQ)!

## First things first

You've just received your ArmoredWitness device, and you want to plug it into your network.

🐯 *Easy, Tiger!* First, let's make sure that it hasn't been tampered with on its way to you.

The [verify](/cmd/verify) tool is used for this, it puts the device into `recovery` mode, and
inspects the firmware stored on the MMC to check that it is unmodified, authentic, and present
in the [firmware transparency](transparency.md) log.

You'll need:

* The ArmoredWitness device
* A Linux computer on which you have `root` priviliges, with:
  * Go 1.22 installed
  * A free USB-A socket to which the device can be connected
  * Internet connectivity
    * Used for fetching the tool, and to allow the tool to contact the firmware transparency logs
* A USB-A to USB-C cable
  * (this is important, it *may* work with some USB-C host ports, but we're aware of a few cases where there were issues due to `USB PD`)

### Verifying the device

First, build the `verify` tool:

```bash
GOBIN=${PWD} go install github.com/transparency-dev/armored-witness/cmd/verify@main
```

Then, you'll need to run it as root and follow the prompts (these looks like "🔷🔷🔷 🙋 OPERATOR: please *do something* 🙏").

> Why root? The `verify` tool needs access to `/dev/hidraw` and `/dev/disk/by-id/usb-F-Secure_USB_*` device files
> in order to put the ArmoredWitness into recovery mode, and read from its internal MMC storage.
> If you have the knowledge to do so, you could use `udev` to grant read-write access to `hid` devices, and `read-only`
> access to the block device.

```

The block of ✅ green ticks towards the end indicates that the firmware on the device was successfully verified.

If you see these green ticks when running against your device, then you can be sure that:

1. Your ArmoredWitness has not been tampered with on its journey from us to you.
1. All 3 pieces of firmware on the device are publicly discoverable via the transparency log.
   * This enables anyone running the [verify_build](/cmd/verify_build) tool to check that all the firmware in the
     log is reproducibly built, and, consequently, to inspect the source code for all released versions of the firmware to see that it's doing only what it claims.

If you see ❌ **red crosses** here this means something is wrong and the tool was unable to verify the device.
You should unplug the device and contact us, perferably via a publicly-visible channel such as the
[transparency-dev slack](https://transparency-dev.slack.com/)
[[invite]](https://join.slack.com/t/transparency-dev/shared_invite/zt-27pkqo21d-okUFhur7YZ0rFoJVIOPznQ).

## Normal operation

For normal operation, the device will need:

* Power (~1.5 Watts normally)\
  Either from:
  * PoE if your switch supports this (or you are using a PoE injector), or
  * Via a USB-A to USB-C cable
  Note that **PoE MUST NOT be used when powering over USB**
* Internet access\
  network configuration should be provided via DHCP.

Ensure that, having completed the verify step above, the sliding switch on the bottom of the device has been
slid fully back towards the USB end of the board, and connect the device to the network (and USB for power,
if not using PoE).

### LEDs

The device has four LEDs on board:

* Green and orange, on the RJ45 network connector.
* White and blue, on the top-side of the board, visible through lenses on the enclosure.

The normal states for the white and blue LEDs are listed in the table below:

| LED    | State                           | Meaning
|---------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------
| Orange        | On                       | No link present on network cable
| Green         | On                       | Good link detected on network cable
| Green         | Blinking                 | Network transmitter/receiver active
| White         | Blinking once per second | The Secure Monitor ("OS") is running ok
| White         | On / off for > 5s        | The Secure Monitor ("OS") has crashed
| Blue          | Blinking once per second | The witness applet is running ok
| Blue          | On / off for > 5s        | The witness applet has crashed/exited
| White & Blue  | Dimly lit                | The device is unable to boot (see below)

## Troubleshooting

### Blue & white LEDs are dim, and device doesn't seem to be doing anything

This indicates that the device was not able to boot, there are two possible causes:

1. The switch on the bottom of the device is in the wrong position.\
   Ensure that the switch is fully positioned towards the USB port, and power-cycle the device.
1. The bootloader firmware is corrupt, or has an incorrect HAB signature.\
   The device will need to be re-provisioned. See instructions [below]{#reinstall}.

### Blue & white LEDs are blinking together/in opposite states

This is fine, this shows that both parts of the firmware are working.

### I've been asked to get logs or other info from the witness

If things seems to have gone awry, we may ask you to collect logs or some other status info from the device
and send it to us.

To do this, you'll generally use the `witnessctl` tool from the github.com/transparency-dev/armored-witness-os repo, and correspondingly will need to have the device plugged in via a USB-A to USB-C cable.
**Note that if you are powering the device via PoE, you MUST unplug the network cable first**.

First build the binary:

```bash
GOBIN=${PWD} go install github.com/transparency-dev/armored-witness-os/cmd/witnessctl@main
```

Then you'll need to run it, with flags as below, using sudo/as root in order for the tool to be
able to read and write to the `/dev/hidraw` devices so as to communicate with the ArmoredWitness OS.

#### Status

Fetch the ArmoredWitness device's status with `witnessctl -s`, e.g.:

```bash
$ sudo ${PWD}/witnessctl -s

##### Crash logs

The "Crash" logs are stored if the device detects a problem and needs to restart the witness.

To fetch these logs, use the `witnessctl -L` command:

```bash
sudo ${PWD}/witnessctl -L
👁️‍🗨️ @ /dev/hidraw0
...
```

An empty response means there are no crash logs.

Be aware that there can be a relatively large amount of log returned, it might be wise to redirect (or `tee`) the
output from the above command into a file.

Fetching the crash log from the device does not erase it, so you can always re-run the above command.

Note that the device only stores logs from the most recent witness restart; a previous crash log will get
overwritten in the event of another unexpected restart.

## Reinstall

You will need to re-run the provision tool, for now, it's probably best to get in touch with us via the
[transparency-dev slack](https://transparency-dev.slack.com/)
[[invite]](https://join.slack.com/t/transparency-dev/shared_invite/zt-27pkqo21d-okUFhur7YZ0rFoJVIOPznQ)
and we'll walk you through it - it's not hard to use the tool, BUT we would certainly like to know that it
seems to be necessary to do it.
