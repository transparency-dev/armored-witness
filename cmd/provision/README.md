# Provision

The `provision` tool is used to provision blank hardware into
production ArmoredWitness devices.

This tool verifies the initial state of a blank ArmoredWitness
device, and then proceeds to flash the various pieces of firmware
onto the device before setting fuses and retrieving the newly
provisioned witness identity.

Note that because of the level of access this tool requires, you
must either run it via `sudo`, or configure `udev` rules etc. to allow
it to inspect & write to appropriate `/dev` files etc.

## Flashing CI or Prod Builds

A device can be configured with builds from the `ci` and `prod` pipelines without
needing much of the tooling in the advanced section of this doc. The first step
is to install the provision tool:

```shell
go install github.com/transparency-dev/armored-witness/cmd/provision@main
```

After this is installed, the tool can be run with the following command to flash
the latest builds of each of the components onto the device:

```shell
sudo $(which provision) \
  --template=${TEMPLATE} \
  --wipe_witness_state
```

where `TEMPLATE` is one of `ci` or `prod`.

Look out for and follow the *"Operator, please do something üôè"* requests as the provision
process executes.

To **permanently** lock the device to either the `ci` or `prod` releases, add the `--fuse` flag
to the above command.

## Provisioning Dev Builds

### Prerequisites

One of the first things the tool will attempt to do is examine
the firmware transparency (FT) log for the latest available versions of the
4 ArmoredWitness firmware types:

* `BOOT`: <https://github.com/transparency-dev/armored-witness-boot>
* `OS`: <https://github.com/transparency-dev/armored-witness-os>
* `APPLET`: <https://github.com/transparency-dev/armored-witness-applet>
* `RECOVERY`: <https://github.com/usbarmory/armory-ums>

For this to succeed, particularly if using a local FT log during development,
please ensure that you have built and logged all 4 types of firmware -
instructions on how to do this are in the main READMEs of the
`armored-witness-*` firmware repos (instructions for logging the recovery image
are in the `armored-witness-boot` README).

### Provisioning development builds

You will also need to supply the following info as flags to the tool:

| Flag                      | Value
|---------------------------|-------
| `--firmware_log_url`      | Base URL of the FT log. Use a`file://...` for local dev FT log. Must end in trailing `/`
| `--firmware_log_origin`   | Log Origin string, for dev use `DEV.armoredwitness.transparency.dev/${USER}`
| `--firmware_log_verifier` | Log public key in note verifier format
| `--binaries_url`          | Base URL to fetch binaries, probably adjacent to FT log location. Must end in trailing `/`
| `--applet_verifier`       | Applet firmware public key in note verifier format
| `--boot_verifier`         | Bootloader firmware public key in note verifier format
| `--os_verifier_1`         | OS firmware public key 1 in note verifier format
| `--os_verifier_2`         | OS firmware public key 2 in note verifier format
| `--recovery_verifier`     | Recovery firmware public key in note verifier format

If you're going to be using this tool more than just a few times, it may be
helpful to have [`uhubctl`](https://github.com/mvp/uhubctl) installed, and
have access to a compatible USB hub - this will enable you to power-cycle/reboot
the device without having to keep unplugging it.

### Usage

First, build the tool (commands assume PWD is the root of the repo):

```bash
go build ./cmd/provision
```

Now run with elevated privileges, e.g.:

```bash
$ sudo ./provision \
    --binaries_url=${BINARIES_URL}/ \
    --firmware_log_url=${LOG_URL}/ \
    --firmware_log_origin=${LOG_ORIGIN} \
    --firmware_log_verifier=$(cat ${LOG_PUBLIC_KEY}) \
    --applet_verifier=$(cat ${APPLET_PUBLIC_KEY}) \
    --boot_verifier=$(cat ${BOOT_PUBLIC_KEY}) \
    --recovery_verifier=$(cat ${RECOVERY_PUBLIC_KEY}) \
    --os_verifier_1=$(cat ${OS_PUBLIC_KEY1}) \
    --os_verifier_2=$(cat ${OS_PUBLIC_KEY2})

The tool will prompt you to ensure that a device is plugged in and has the boot switch set correctly:

```bash
I1012 12:15:41.216806  292650 main.go:226] Operator, please ensure boot switch is set to USB, and then connect unprovisioned device üôè
I1012 12:15:41.216809  292650 main.go:314] Waiting for device to be detected...
```

When it detects a device, it will continue with the flashing process:

```bash

Once complete, it will ask you to flip the boot swith and reboot the device:

```bash
I1012 12:18:10.816923  292650 main.go:278] Operator, please change boot switch to MMC, and then reboot device üôè

```

When you've done this, the device should boot into the witness firmware which the `provision` tool will detect:

```bash
